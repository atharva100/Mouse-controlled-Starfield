# Mouse-controlled-Starfield

A starfield animation project made via the creative Javascript library ,p5js.

Ive been deep diving into exploring the weirdness of javascript and what better way to enjoy the experience than making dumb projects :)

Used p5js as its a creative coding library and fantastic for animations and experimenting with programming logic in general

Took longer to debug than to write the main code :)

Made the Starfield interactive by using mouseControls as coordinates of velocity.
